# MinecraftAvatars

This is a Ruby gem that allows you to easily retrieve a player's raw Minecraft skin from Amazon S3 (http://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftSkins/notch.png) and restructure it into a variety of usable sizes and formats.

It relies on the simple pure ruby 'chunky_png' library to parse and restructure the skins, rather than huge libraries like RMagick.

## Installation
